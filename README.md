Welcome to the **Library Management System**, a desktop application built by **Arman Bhatia** using **Java Swing** for an intuitive user interface and **JDBC** with **MySQL Connector/J** for robust database connectivity. This project simulates a real-world library, enabling efficient management of books, members, and borrowing/returning transactions, all structured with the **MVC architecture**.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture for clean code organization:

- **Model**: Data classes (`Book`, `Member`, `Transaction`, `Authentication`) for business logic
- **View**: Java Swing classes for the user interface
- **Controller**: Handles user interactions and application logic
- **Database**: Manages MySQL connections and queries
- **Utils**: Helper classes for input validation and utilities

### Package Structure
```
com.library
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model         // Data classes (Book, Member, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ view          // Swing GUI classes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ controller    // Event handling and logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database      // MySQL connection and operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils         // Helper classes (e.g., validators)
```

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The system uses **MySQL** with the following tables to store data persistently:

### 1. `authentication`
Stores user credentials and roles.
```sql
CREATE TABLE authentication (
    auth_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    role ENUM('admin', 'librarian') DEFAULT 'librarian' NULL
);
```

### 2. `books`
Manages book inventory.
```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
    book_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    author VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    isbn VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NULL,
    status VARCHAR(15) NULL,
    added_date VARCHAR(30) NULL
);
```

### 3. `members`
Stores member information.
```sql
CREATE TABLE members (
    member_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20) NULL,
    registration_date VARCHAR(20) NULL
);
```

### 4. `transactions`
Tracks book borrowing and returning.
```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    transaction_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    book_id INT NULL,
    member_id INT NULL,
    issue_date DATE NOT NULL,
    return_date DATE NULL,
    fine DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0.00 NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (book_id) REFERENCES books(book_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (member_id) REFERENCES members(member_id)
);
CREATE INDEX book_id ON transactions(book_id);
CREATE INDEX member_id ON transactions(member_id);
```

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java 17** or higher
- **MySQL** (version 8.0 or later recommended)
- **MySQL Connector/J** (JDBC driver)
- **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse** (recommended)
- **Git** for version control
- MySQL Workbench (optional for database management)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArmanBhatia0100/Book_Store_Management_Software.git
   cd Book_Store_Management_Software
   ```

2. **Set up MySQL**:
   - Ensure MySQL is installed and running.
   - Create a database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE library_db;
     ```
   - Use the database:
     ```sql
     USE library_db;
     ```
   - Run the SQL schema provided above to create the tables.
   - Example command in MySQL terminal or Workbench:
     ```bash
     mysql -u yourusername -p library_db < schema.sql
     ```
     (Save the schema in a `schema.sql` file or execute it directly in MySQL Workbench.)

3. **Configure the database connection**:
   - Update the database configuration in `database/DatabaseConnection.java` with your MySQL credentials:
     ```java
     String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/library_db";
     String username = "your_mysql_username";
     String password = "your_mysql_password";
     ```

4. **Add MySQL Connector/J**:
   - Download the [MySQL Connector/J](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/) JAR file (e.g., `mysql-connector-j-8.x.x.jar`).
   - Add it to your project‚Äôs classpath in IntelliJ or Eclipse.

5. **Build and run**:
   - Open the project in IntelliJ or Eclipse.
   - Ensure the MySQL Connector/J JAR is included in the project dependencies.
   - Build the project and run the `Main` class to launch the application.
